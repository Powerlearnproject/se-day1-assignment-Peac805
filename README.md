Software Engineering Day1 Assignment
#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering
Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
software engineering is the branch of computer science that deals with the design, development, testing and maintenance of software applications.
software engineers apply engineering principles and knowledge of programming languages to build software solutions for end users.
Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
the process of developing 
maintaining 
and updating software for various reasons.
List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
requirements 
design 
implementation 
testing development 
and maintenance 
this model involves repetitive cycles of development, allowing for feedback and improvement in each iteration.
Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
waterfall is a better method when a project must meet strict regulations as it requires deliverables for each phase before proceeding to the next one. 
Agile is better suited for teams that plan on moving fast, experiment with direction and don't know how the final project will look before the start.
examples are: Before deciding what toils or frameworks to ddopt
people over process asks us to build the right team of people first 
Aligning them towards the end user's goals.
Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
create, develop, and test software elements, either writing the code yourself or preparing the documentation necessary for other programmers to write the code.
A quality assurance engineer: design test plans, scenarios, scripts, or procedures.
A project manager roles and responsibilities are: overseeing the planning, execution and delivery of software projects.
Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
An integrated development environment (IDEs) is a software suite that consolidateds basic tools required to write and test software. example: Microsoft Visual Studio code.
version control system (VCS) allows developer to track changes to their code, collaborate with others, and revert to earlier versions of their code if necessary. example: Git.
What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
challenges face by software engineers are: Rapid advancement of technology 
Growing customer demands
time constraints 
limited infrastructure 
software testing conflicts 
changing requirements 
limited time and resources 
security.
How to overcome the challenges are: Identify the problem 
Analyze the problem 
Brainstorm 
Make a decision 
Implement 
Evaluate.
Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit tests focus on individual components, such as methods and functions, while integration tests check if these components work together properly.
#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering
Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the process where you guide generative artificial intelligence (generative AI) solutions to generate desired outputs. 
The importance are: It makes it easy for users to obtain relevant results in the first prompt.
it helps mitigate bias that may be present from existing humans bias in the large language modles training data.
It enchances the user-AI interaction so the AI understands ther user's intention even with minimal input.
Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
it a phrase like "Tell me everything about...
Improved prompt is effective because it describe the best 
describe the process.
